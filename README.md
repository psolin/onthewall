"Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?" - from Snow White (1937). This is often misquoted as "mirror mirror".

Run voicecontrol.py on a computer with microphone access. Utter the secret phrase ("mirror mirror") to get it to respond.

Edit this the script to automate voice commands. As long as the script is running, it is listening and sending the data back to Google for processing.

### Prerequisites

Make sure that you run...

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

...before you run the script.

If you are on a Mac, make sure you have "flac" installed through Homebrew:

```
brew install flac
```

This script runs in Python 3.
